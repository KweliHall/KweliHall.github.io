> "Perfection is not attainable, but if we chase perfection, we can catch excellence"

At the start of august 2021 I didn't know how to write a single line of code. Fast forward to February 2022 I am building out full stack applications on my own. My mom has been trying to get me to code for years, and I never gave it a chance. After I graduated High School we talked about a web development bootcamp called Devmountain, a sister school to the company she works for, and the rest was history. I've fallen in love with coding and the endless amount of freedom you have while developing websites/apps.
